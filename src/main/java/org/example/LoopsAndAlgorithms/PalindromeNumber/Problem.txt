Difficulty: Moderate

Problem Description: A number is called a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

  Instructions:

    1. Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is a palindrome.
    2. You must use a method to reverse the digits of the number.
    3. Compare the reversed number with the original number to determine if it's a palindrome.
    4. Handle both positive and negative numbers. A negative number cannot be a palindrome.
