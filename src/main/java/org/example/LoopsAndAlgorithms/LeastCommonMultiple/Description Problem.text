Problem Statement

Write a program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two positive integers.
The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.

Requirements

        1. Use the relationship between GCD and LCM:

            lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)
            Ensure you handle integer overflow when multiplying a and b.

        2. Implement a method findLCM(int a, int b) that:

            Calls your gcd method to calculate the GCD.
            Uses the GCD to find the LCM.

        3. In the main method:

            Prompt the user to enter two positive integers.
            Call the findLCM method and display the result.
            Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
