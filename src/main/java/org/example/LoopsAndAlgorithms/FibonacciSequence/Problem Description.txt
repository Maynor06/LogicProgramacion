Exercise: Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Write a program to generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Requirements

    1. Accept an integer n (greater than 0) as input from the user.
    2. Generate and display the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    3. Handle invalid inputs gracefully, such as negative numbers or zero.
    4. Use iteration instead of recursion for better performance.
