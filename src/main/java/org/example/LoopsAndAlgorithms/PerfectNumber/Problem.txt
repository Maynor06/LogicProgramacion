Problem Statement:
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).
For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and their sum is 1+2+3=6.

    Write a program that:

    1. Prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
    2. Determines whether the number is a perfect number.
    3. Outputs whether the number is perfect or not.
