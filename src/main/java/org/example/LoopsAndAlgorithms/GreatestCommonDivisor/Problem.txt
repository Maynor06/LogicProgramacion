Problem statement

Write a program that takes two positive integers as input and calculates their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.


    Requirements
Use the Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the GCD:

If a and b are two numbers, gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b) until b == 0. At that point, a is the GCD.
Implement the logic in a separate method called findGCD(int a, int b).

In the main method:

    1. Prompt the user to enter two positive integers.
    2. Call the findGCD method and print the result.
Handle invalid input (e.g., negative numbers or zero) by displaying a message and exiting the program.
