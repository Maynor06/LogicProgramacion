Exercise: Matrix Transposition
Write a Java program to calculate the transpose of a matrix.

What is a Transpose?
The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping rows into columns and columns into rows. For example:

Input Matrix:
    1  2  3
    4  5  6
    7  8  9

Transpose of the Matrix
    1  4  7
    2  5  8
    3  6  9

Requirements:
    1. Prompt the user to input the dimensions of the matrix (rows and columns).
    2. Allow the user to enter the elements of the matrix.
    3. Calculate the transpose and display the resulting matrix.
